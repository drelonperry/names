This program utilizes the pandas library to sort various data files into 
graphs and tables for a better view of the data that I created for 
my Data Science class.

To execute the program, from the command line convert the code from notebook to
python by using this command:
jupyter nbconvert --to python nb.ipynb

After the command has been ran, execute the program like a python program by doing:
python nb.py

You may need to install the python mistune package for this to work and here is the
command for that:
sudo pip install -U mistune
